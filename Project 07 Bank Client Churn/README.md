## Project 07 (Supervised Learning) - Bank Client Churn

A considerable number of clients started leaving the bank that provided the data and it's best to retain them because as it turns out it's more cost-efficient than running a new advertising campaign to grow the client base anew. I developed a predictive model to detect them and assist the bank to prevent the churn.
