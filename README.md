Training Projects

## Welcome! 

Here one should find the projects made during my Data Science journey at Practicum by Yandex. \
Here's my [review](https://www.facebook.com/yerzhankaratay/posts/10221278439968086) of the training 

## Projects

As of now, I've only published and described some of the projects that I translated in English, so I'll be adding what's left.

### Available Projects

1 **[Game Market Analysis](https://github.com/yerzhankaratay/Yandex.Practicum/tree/master/05%20Game%20Market%20Analysis)** \
*Integrated Project 1* \
(04) Being provided data by an online store selling video games I conducted a market analysis and found the present most popular (or best selling) platforms and genres by region to define what the best groups of products, i.e. video games to advertise are.

2 **[Bank Client Churn](https://github.com/yerzhankaratay/Yandex.Practicum/tree/master/07%20Bank%20Client%20Churn)** \
(06) *Supervised Learning* \
A considerable number of clients started leaving the bank that provided the data and it's best to retain them because as it turns out it's more cost-efficient than running a new advertising campaign to grow the client base anew. I developed a predictive model to detect them and help the bank to prevent the churn.

3 **[Toxic Comment Classification](https://github.com/yerzhankaratay/Yandex.Practicum/tree/master/13%20Toxic%20Comment%20Classification)** \
(12) *Machine Learning for Texts* \
An online store has enabled its customers to write article descriptions and comment the changes, now there is a number of toxic comments among 160 thousand written ones, and there will be new ones, so I built a machine learning model that is supposed to predict toxicity of new comments by learning from the marked up ones and it should assist the moderators.
