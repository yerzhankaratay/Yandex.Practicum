Training Projects

## Welcome! 

One should find the projects made during my Data Science journey at Practicum by Yandex in this repository.
Here's my review of the training https://www.facebook.com/yerzhankaratay/posts/10221278439968086

## Projects

As of now, I've only published and described some of the projects that I translated in English, so I'll be adding them.

### Available Projects

05 **Game Market Analysis** \
*Integrated Project 1* \
Being provided data by an online store selling video games I conducted a market analysis and found the present most popular (or best selling) platforms and genres by region to define what the best groups of products, i.e. video games to advertise are.

07 **Bank Client Churn** \
*Supervised Learning* \
A considerable number of clients started leaving the bank that provided the data and it's best to retain them because as it turns out it's more cost-efficient than running a new advertising campaign to grow the client base anew. I developed a predictive model to detect them and assist the bank to prevent the churn.

13 **Toxic Comment Classification** \
*Machine Learning for Texts* \
An online store has enabled its customers to write article descriptions and comment the changes, now there is a number of toxic comments among 160 thousand written ones, and there will be new ones, so I built a machine learning model that is supposed to predict toxicity of new comments by learning from the marked up ones and it should assist the moderators.
